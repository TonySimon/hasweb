title: Cancellation & Refund Policy

## Job Board

HasGeek reserves the right to consider refunding the purchase amount for such a listing. By issuing a submission to the job board, you acknowledge full awareness of that your purchase amount may not be refunded.

## Events

You cannot cancel your ticket for an event if you have purchased that ticket using our online payment option. We may cancel an event due to unforeseen reasons or circumstances outside our control (Force Majeure events such as floods, fire, riots, terrorist incidents, bandhs, etc). If that happens, refund of your purchase amount will be subject to HasGeek's discretion. 

## Advertising

Advertisers may cancel their order through Customer's account if online cancellation functionality is available, or, if not available, with prior written notice to HasGeek, including without limitation electronic mail.  The cancellation of any advertising may be subject to HasGeek’s Advertising Program policies or HasGeek’s ability to re-schedule reserved inventory or cancel ads already in production. Cancelled ads may be published despite cancellation if cancellation of those ads occurs after any applicable commitment date as set forth in advance by HasGeek, in which case Advertiser must pay for those ads.

In case you feel that the product or service received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service at <support@hasgeek.com> within 24 hours of receiving the product or service. The Customer Service Team, after looking into your complaint, will take an appropriate decision.
